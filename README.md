## Kitchen Chaos — an interactive A/V micro‑story

### Concept
An everyday kitchen slips from calm preparation into escalating mishaps and, finally, full chaos. You conduct the narrative with simple gestures, and the world answers in sound and playful, candy‑pastel visuals. 

### Narrative flow
1. Preparing → 2. Cooking → 3. Accident Breakout → 4. Chaos
- Transitions are driven by on‑screen cues (no timers). Each cue may play a sound, start/stop a loop, or jump to the next state.
- Short lines of text narrate what just happened. All text is rendered centered on the canvas.

### Interaction
- Click, hold, or drag only. The next cue tells you which gesture advances.
- Opening prompt: “Click Anywhere to Start Cooking” (centered). State enter lines set the tone; event lines describe outcomes.
- Each event’s line appears after a brief beat (≈2.5 s), fading in gently so the ear leads and the eye follows.

### Audio language
- One‑shots for discrete actions; sustained beds for ongoing sources (stove, hissing, boiling).
- Spatialization mirrors on‑screen x‑position; a gentle delay send blooms during Chaos to thicken the space.

### Visual language
- Minimal, stylized, candy‑pastel abstractions keyed to each sound (rings, stripes, sprays, shakes, spectrograms).
- Everything renders on a pixel‑space orthographic canvas with a subtle kitchen grid behind; text is centered and scales with canvas size.

### Why this story
Kitchen Chaos is about the comedy of small failures. Sound lands first, visuals punctuate, and text arrives last—inviting you to feel cause → effect → meaning, one beat at a time.
